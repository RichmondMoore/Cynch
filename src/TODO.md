# TODO:

- Look into ways to optimize run(), instead of using a switch:
    - "direct threaded code," "jump table," "computed goto" (Chapter 15)
- Swap to a register-based VM
- Re-comment vm.c and vm.h
- Turn 'print' into a native function rather than a statement
- Add inclusion for "mixfix"
    - Ex. the ternary operator
